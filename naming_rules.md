COP3503 Group 9 Project Naming Style Guide
==========================================
_Largely derived from [Google C++ Style Guide naming](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming) (with some modifications)_

## General Rules

* Names should be descriptive; avoid abbreviation.
* Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a new reader.

## File Names

Keep file names all lowercase with underscores between words

## Classes, Structs, Enums, & Type Template Paramaters

* Use UpperCamelCase (aka PascalCase).  
* Capitalize every word

## Variable Names

* Typically, use all lowercase characters
* Use underscores between words in a name
* **Class** data members have an additional underscore after the name
* **Struct** data members follow normal naming rules, however
* **const** (constants) use CamelCase with a k in front (ex. kMyConstant)

## Function Names

Use lowerCamelCase for function names

## Namespace Names

Use all lowercase characters

## Enumerator Names

Follow the same rules as for **const** variables
